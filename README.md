# CatvsDog

## Introduction
#### This is deep learning program which uses keras to tell whether their is a cat or dog in the image. The drawback of this program is that if both are present simultaneously then it cannot differentiate between them.

## Requirements
  1. Python 3.5+
  2. Keras
  3. Tensorflow for keras backend.
  
#### NOTE: I have used non-gpu version of tensorflow. You can also use gpu version.  

## How to run
  1. Install python 3.5+ (not tested on python 2.7+)
  2. Open cmd type
    ```
      pip install keras, tensorflow
    ```
  3. Create a new directory anywhere and type following in cmd
    ```
      git clone https://github.com/gagan0906/CatvsDog/
    ```
  4. Open cmd in same directory and type
    ```
      python catordog.py
    ```
